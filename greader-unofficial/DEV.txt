Information for developers:
---------------------------
For those of you familiar with Maven, you know the drill...
For all others, you can generate an Eclipse project very easily using:

mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true

Once the eclipse project is generated, you can import it in your workspace and start playing :)


Otherwise, the maven2eclipse plugin can directly check-out a project out a SCM and create the project for you...
